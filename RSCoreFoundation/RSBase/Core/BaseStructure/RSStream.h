 a client to hear about interesting events that occur on a stream.  Only one client
 per stream is allowed; registering a new client replaces the previous one.
 
 Once you have set a client, the stream must be scheduled to provide the context in
 which the client will be called.  Streams may be scheduled on a single dispatch queue
 or on one or more run loops.  If scheduled on a run loop, it is the caller's responsibility
 to ensure that at least one of the scheduled run loops is being run.
 
 NOTE: Unlike other CoreFoundation APIs, pasing a NULL clientContext here will remove
 the client.  If you do not care about the client context (i.e. your only concern
 is that your callback be called), you should pass in a valid context where every
 entry is 0 or NULL.
